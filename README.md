Excel Data Analysis Project
This project demonstrates essential data analysis techniques in Excel, focusing on cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data to derive insights. Key steps include:
1. Data Cleaning: Removed duplicate entries for improved data accuracy.
2. Data Refinement: Used Find and Replace to make column values more understandable.
3. Data Transformation: Applied an IF function to categorize ages into brackets, creating a new column.
4. Table Conversion: Transformed the raw dataset into a structured Excel table.
5. Data Analysis: Inserted a Pivot Table to uncover insights and create meaningful charts.
6. Dashboard Creation: Designed an interactive dashboard with charts, slicers, and dynamic visuals based on Pivot Table outputs.
   
This repository highlights the power of Excel for effective data analysis and visualization.
